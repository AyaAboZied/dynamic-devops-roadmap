## 5.1 Planning - Refine the Goals and Requirements

### What you need to know

- At this point, you should have a working [project](../../projects/hivebox). It might not be perfect but good enough as start. Now it's time to start polishing it.
- First of all, you need to align with the business objectives. Is the project still relevant? Has the business changed direction, which requires changes in the tech side? Ensuring that the goals and requirements are aligned with the business means understanding the business context, market demands, and how you, as a DevOps engineer, can drive value to the company.
- OK, let's assume there have been no changes in the business directions. Now, it's essential to review the goals according to user feedback. You need to gather user feedback after using the first version of the solution you developed.
- Mostly, DevOps Engineers' users are other teams in the organization, but it could also be useful to get the end-users feedback via Product Owners/Managers.- You will refine your solution based on the business directions and user feedback. Establishing cross-functional collaboration with other teams (especially with the QA team) is also vital to ensure smooth end-to-end deliverability.
- From now on, you need to start building continuous feedback loops. They could have a simple structure, such as recutting meetings with different teams. We will cover this topic in detail in the next module.
- In general, planning should be considered a moving target. Goals should always be iterated to ensure they meet the requirements.

## 5.2 Code - Working with External Systems

### What you need to know

- As a DevOps Engineer, you will work or integrate with external systems using code or tools. Those external systems could be third-party APIs, databases, cloud services, or microservices.
- You will mostly use REST APIs to interact with those services, but there are many ways to communicate with those systems according to each use case.
- Here, we will cover some essential points when working with external systems programmatically.
  - If it's a known system, it's usually better to use a library or SDK for that system. Don't write everything from scratch.
  - Ensure to handle errors and rate limits. Know how to implement rate-limiting strategies (e.g., exponential backoff).
  - Ensure you handle paginated responses (e.g., retrieving data in chunks), especially if you expect a big load of data.
  - Use caching whenever possible. Don't hummer the systems with unnecessary calls.
  - Always use secure connection with external systems even if the use case is trivial.
  - Not every connection should be synced; you could use async communication by using message queues to deal with lagging and latency under pressure.

## 5.3 Code - Writing Integration Tests

### What you need to know

- The second level of the tests is the `Integration Test`. Its primary role is to ensure that different components or modules of your system work well together. To have a good integration test, you need to remember a couple of points.
- As usual, start with basic tests, then extend the test scenarios as you go.
- Tests should be as simple as possible; otherwise, you will end up with complex test code that needs another test to ensure it's working as expected!
- Ensure maintainability and readability using well-known tools and frameworks, and avoid writing your own code as a test framework.
- Always try to use real systems and avoid mocking too much. For example, if you are testing interactions with a database, run an actual database instance and code test against it.
- Always verify both paths to success and failure! Don't test the happy path only.
- Try to run the integration tests in an environment as close as possible to production, at least one that has the same technology as production. For example, if you are using containers in production, then the integration tests should also be run in containers.
- Try to use realistic (but minimal) test data to cover a variety of cases like your real users (e.g., using factories and/or fixtures).
- As much as possible, isolate tests from each other so you get accurate results. Each test group should be independent and not rely on other test groups' actions.
- Remember the external services (third-party APIs) when you write integration tests. Use sandbox or test environments provided by these services, or simulate them with API stubs (check the previous section about [Working with External Systems](#52-code---working-with-external-systems)).
- By default, tests should be integrated with CI/CD pipelines and run automatically after each commit or before merging. But also think about providing an easy way to run locally.
