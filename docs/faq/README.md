Here are the most common questions about this roadmap.


## Is this roadmap free?

Yes! This roadmap is licensed under the open-source license [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en). All extra reading resources referenced in the roadmap are publicly accessible.

Yet, given that no size fits all, the extra reading resources are considered the best from the author's point of view. You can use any resources suitable for you (e.g., content in your language). You can use this roadmap with a local mentor or a senior friend.


## Is this a course?

No, it's a roadmap! It guides you on a high level following a `Guided Learning` model, which is learner-centric. It supports the learner's journey towards understanding the DevOps problems and hands-on application without spoon-feeding. That works best in pairing with other learners or with a mentor (you still could make it without a mentor if you can stick to the plan)

So, you need to learn about each topic mentioned using external resources (such as a book, a self-paced course, or an instructor).


## What is the problem this roadmap is trying to solve?

It's simple: Why is it so hard to start a DevOps career nowadays?

### The Problem

The `DevOps Engineer` role remains one of the top 10 most in-demand jobs across all industries (not just the tech field!). However, starting that role is super challenging because the DevOps model has various patterns and topologies. Also, the Cloud Native landscape keeps expanding, and there is something new every day!

Simply, **you cannot start a DevOps position by merely learning the tools!** It's even more complicated if that's your first job without previous software industry experience (coming from either Dev or Ops).

For that reason, almost every day, I see people struggling on their way to start as fresh/junior DevOps engineers or even progress in their early career years in general. They usually follow some `linear` roadmap like [roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops). But still, they cannot land their first job or struggle a lot when they find one! And sadly, many of them eventually give up!

### The Solution

Based on experience for years mentoring people in different stages (starting their first job, career shift, moving to another work style or company), using a `dynamic MVP-style roadmap` with hands-on projects designed by an experienced DevOps engineer has been highly successful.

That means **first, understanding the problem instead of just learning a bunch of tools** and then **using an iterative style, each iteration will cover most DevOps areas used in the job** to build a T-shaped skills profile from day one! It's also essential to set the targeted market and organizations because, with different DevOps topologies, the DevOps engineer role requirements vary a lot.

## Who is the target audience for this roadmap?

This roadmap is designed for a wide range of audiences, but each requires different efforts and risks (risk groups).

- **Group A (Low effort, no risk):** A DevOps engineer who wants to refresh their mind and ensure they are aware of essentials and best practices in the Cloud-Native area.
- **Group B (Medium effort, low risk):** A Dev or Ops engineer who wants to make a career shift and become a DevOps engineer.
- **Group C (Medium effort, medium risk):** A technical-related engineer who wants to make a career shift and become a DevOps engineer (the risk depends on how involved the engineer is in the Software Development Life Cycle).
- **Group D (High effort, high risk):** A fresh graduate who wants to approach a DevOps career as a first job (If you are not a person who sticks to long-term plans, it's recommended to start the roadmap with a mentor).
- **Group E (High effort, extra high risk):** A person from a non-technical background approaches a DevOps career as a first job (If you are not a person who sticks to long-term plans, it's recommended to start the roadmap with a mentor. Also, alternatively begin first as a Dev or Ops for 2-3 years then switch to DevOps).


## What is the expected timeline to finish this roadmap?

It totally depends on your background, available time, and the risk group you are in, whether you are doing it alone or with a mentor.

Basically, the outcome is based on three factors: `time`, `effort`, and `cost` ... pick two!

Roughly, the timeline is the following:

- **Group A (Low effort, no risk):** 1-2 months.
- **Group B (Medium effort, low risk):** 3-4 months.
- **Group C (Medium effort, medium risk):** 3-5 months.
- **Group D (High effort, high risk):** 4-6 months.
- **Group E (High effort, extra high risk):** 4-9 months.
