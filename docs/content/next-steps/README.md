[ðŸ—‚ Back to the Roadmap Index](../../getting-started#roadmap-index)

Now that you've finished the roadmap, what's next? There is good news and bad news! The good news is that finishing this roadmap should increase your chances in the market. The bad news is that the tech industry is always evolving super fast, and the DevOps domain evolves even faster! So there are no options but to keep going and always stay in shape! 

It's time to face the real world and prepare for the next steps. We will cover some topics to help you step up and keep developing yourself.

## Your CV/Resume, Cover Letter, and LinkedIn Profile

- Like it or not, we all know that `First impressions are lasting`! So, the first step is to ensure you have a good one.
- You should read a post or two about this topic, but here are some essential highlights.
- **CV/Resume:**
  - Review wording and avoid typos. Also, use the correct spelling! For example, it's `DevOps`, not `Devops` or `dev-ops`, and so on.
  - Use a template for CVs; don't create one from scratch! No need to reinvent the wheel and there are already good templates for tha propose.
  - Make your CV short and concise but not too tight. Many people try to make a one-page CV, but they make it unreadable!
  - Write a quick summary about yourself but not that dull "objectives" section.
  - Write your skill set first, then your job experience (`Summary` -> `Skill Set` -> `Experience` -> Anything else).
  - Sort the information in reverse chronological order (newer first, older last).
  - Write in bullet points and avoid long paragraphs.
  - Focus on impact before what you just did. Focus on the accomplishments instead of the responsibilities.
  - It's good to write in the footer of your CV when the last update was.
  - There is no need to add unnecessary information about you, like age, marital status, etc.
  Unless otherwise requested, always export and send your CV in PDF format so it always appears the same way for everybody.
 - **Cover Letter:**
   - The cover letter is usually optional, but post it anyway when applying for the job. Why would you lose a plus point?
   - Unlike the CV, which doesn't need to be changed much across job applications, the cover letter should be tailored for each application! Don't copy/paste your cover letter as it is every time!
   - Ensure to mention the position title and team in the first line of the cover letter.
   - The format is basic, with just 3 sections. First is a very concise summary of you. Second is which changes completely based on each job description. The third could have any relevant, helpful information like a side project or some skill that will benefit you in that job.
   - Read the job description and update your cover letter to show how you are the best fit for that position.
   - Don't write the cover letter too long; it will be less likely to be read.
   - Don't repeat exactly what's in the CV.
 - **LinkedIn Profile:**
   - The previous points are more or less applicable to the LinkedIn profile, but there are some differences here and there.
   - [Customize your LinkedIn URL](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a542685/manage-your-public-profile-url?lang=en). Remove any extra characters in the URL and just keep your name like `https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-doe`.
   - Use a proper, up-to-date photo and ensure the profile details are updated regularly.
   - Add a profile "about" section and tagline.
   - Follow people in your domain to get the best out of your LinkedIn timeline.
   - Check your LinkedIn account at least once a week or so.
   - Keep it professional; at the end of the day, LinkedIn is not Facebook! (there are always exceptions, but that's still the rule of thumb).

## Your Skills Chart

- At this point, you should know your strengths and weaknesses. Reflect on your current skills to find what you are good at and what you could be better at.
- This will help you to visualize your competencies, identify gaps, and track growth over time.
- It's recommended to use a `Radar Chart` (Spider Chart) with 5 levels and map the current and target level based on your goals (e.g., targeting a new market or job).
- The chart alone is not enough; always combine it with a one-page document that adds some context about your skills.
- Use the chart as a high-level for your next steps and career development.
- Update your skill chart at least once every year or, even better, every 6 months.
- You can do this yourself, but it's highly recommended that you do it with someone close to you. 
- Ask for feedback whenever possible. 
- Always remember that ... you must be honest with yourself; otherwise, the whole process will be worthless!

## DevOps Certificates

- There is always a big debate about certificates and doubts about whether they are helpful or not! The reality is they are as useful as you put effort into them! If you just finish them with minimal understanding, they will not help you much. But if you understand every aspect and read more about each topic, they will greatly help you.
- A certificate is a means to an end, not an end itself! Hence, **we cover certificates or courses without being certified**. We don't judge the certificate itself but its value.
- As a DevOps Engineer, you need 3 types of certificates or courses:
  - **Cloud:** Get the **associate** certificate for one of the Cloud providers, which will mostly be AWS (it could be a bit different based on the targeted market, but AWS is the most popular one).
  - **Kubernetes:** Get at least one of the Kubernetes certificates like CKA and CKAD because, as mentioned before ... Kubernetes is the new Linux now!
  - **Soft Skills**: Work is not just about tech skills! Ensure that you learn about soft skills as early as possible in your career. It's not necessary to get a paid certificate at this point, but at least finish one of the courses in that area.
- Other certificates will not harm you, but as mentioned before, the most important point here is that you really understand the topic and read more about each area. Don't treat them as collecting stickers.
- It is also worth mentioning that this section is for most DevOps engineers. If you work for a consulting company, you will probably need to tackle this area a bit differently.
