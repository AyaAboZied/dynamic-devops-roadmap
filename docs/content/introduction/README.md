## Overview

Starting a DevOps engineer role is challenging because the DevOps model has various implementations and patterns. It's even more complicated (but still possible) if that's your first job without previous software industry experience. Yet, many learning roadmaps like [roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops) still follow a linear path (i.e., learn some topic to the end, then move to another, and so on) which doesn't work well with the DevOps role because a skilled DevOps engineer is a T-Shaped skilled.

Adopting a dynamic MVP learning roadmap increases your chances of entering the market and starting your first job as a DevOps engineer without previous software hands-on experience.

Hence, this roadmap comes to fill that gap using the same Agile methodologies using a `dynamic MVP-style roadmap` with hands-on projects designed by an experienced DevOps engineer has been highly successful.

That means **first, understand the problem instead of just learning a bunch of tools** then **using iterative style, each iteration will cover most DevOps areas used in the job** to build a T-shaped skills profile from day one! It's also essential to set the targeted market and organizations because, with different DevOps topologies, the DevOps engineer role requirements vary a lot.

## Learning Strategy

This roadmap is designed as a hands-on and progressive project. It's not just about tech aspects of the DevOps, but also end-to-end software production as you will do in your daily job. For that reason, the roadmap mainly follows a modified version of the [SET model](https://morethandigital.info/en/set-model-for-business-strategy-planning-survive-expand-transform/). But instead of `survive, expand, transform` it's `basics, start, expand, transform`. So even though SET model is more about business, but here we are using the same notion to build a roadmap like real-world.

## Focus Areas

Technical-wise, the roadmap focuses on typical DevOps Engineer who is part of a software company, yet, it still shares at least 90% of the needed skills with the other roles like Cloud Engineer, Platform Engineer, and SRE.

The roadmap has a [multiphase industry-grad project](../../projects/hivebox) follows `Learning by Doing` method (aka `Problem-based Learning`) which is also done in iterative phases where you learn as you go and cover the whole DevOps cycle like Code, Containers, Testing, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Observability, and Infrastructure. Each phase of this project is tackled gradually, part of the roadmap modules. But it's also **standalone**, and you can work on it if you have the required knowledge for each phase.

## DevOps Topology

Finally, this roadmap is designed for the cloud-native post-container era, which means it will mainly focus on modern practices like Cloud, Docker, and Kubernetes. That doesn't mean everything should be complex, but just about [treating your servers like cattle, not pets](https://www.hava.io/blog/cattle-vs-pets-devops-explained). For example, using Kubernetes doesn't always mean you need to create or manage Kubernetes clusters! There are now many serverless Kubernetes solutions like AWS EKS Fargate or GCP GKE Autopilot. So this roadmap doesn't claim there is a one way of doing DevOps, because DevOps already has many [implementations and topologies](https://web.devopstopologies.com/), but as mentioned focus on modern practices and technologies.
