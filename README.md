## Frequently Asked Questions

It's highly recommended to read the [FAQ page](https://devopsroadmap.io/faq/) before starting with roadmap.

## The Problem

</a>

The `DevOps Engineer` role remains one of the top 10 most in-demand jobs across all industries (not just the tech field!). However, starting that role is super challenging because the DevOps model has various patterns and topologies. Also, the Cloud Native landscape keeps expanding, and there is something new every day!

Simply, **you cannot start a DevOps position by merely learning the tools!** It's even more complicated if that's your first job without previous software industry experience (coming from either Dev or Ops). Also following `linear` roadmaps like [roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops) cannot help to land your first job and probably will struggle a lot when you find one!

For more details about the problem aspects, please read: [What is the problem this roadmap is trying to solve](https://devopsroadmap.io/faq/)


## The Solution

<p align="center">

    <img alt="Dynamic MVP-style roadmap Good and Bad" border="0" width="90%" src="static/img/dynamic-devops-roadmap-pillars.png" />
  </a>
</p>

Using a `MVP-style roadmap` with hands-on projects has been highly successful.

That means **first, understanding the problem instead of just learning a bunch of tools** and then **using an iterative style, each iteration will cover most DevOps areas used in the job** to build a T-shaped skills profile from day one!

For more details, check the next section.

## The Roadmap

This roadmap is `polymorphic`, which means it's designed to work in different modes. It depends on how fast you want to go (roadmap, mentorship, or bootcamp).
